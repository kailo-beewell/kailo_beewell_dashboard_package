# Standard #BeeWell survey scores

This table summarises the scoring for each topic in the standard #BeeWell survey (including the directionality and range of scores for the questions themselves, and for the overall topic score).

**Topic scores all positive:** I have converted all topic scores to have a higher score being the more positive outcome. This was to help simplify the presentation of information. If you have a mix of high scores being positive and negative, then describing results as "above average" or "below average" is confusing. I considered a range of options for this issue, and ultimately decided on converting all to positive. However, considerations included:
* Phrasing as "better than average" or "worse than average" (too lengthy for summary page, without shrinking font)
* Phrasing as "more positive" or "more negative" (misses the key component about relationship to average)
* Phrasing as "above average" or "below average" and then explaining that above average can mean a high or low score (feels really confusing)
* Converting all to positive direction and then phrasing as "above average" or "below average" and explaining higher score is more positive nad lower score is more negative (feels like the simplest answer)

This does however mean that you need to be wary of directly comparing scores between GM and Devon, as GM use a mix of directions.

**Further information:** To see exactly how scores were calculated, please see the relevant sections of Python code in this repository.

**Abbreviations:**
* GM (Greater Manchester) - referring to their dashboards from implementation of #BeeWell.
* exc. (exclude) - often for responses that would exclude from scoring like "don't know" or "unsure"
